### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Baptiste, I'm 19 and I live in France. 
I started programming around 2019 with Python and now I work on some personal and school projects. 
I enjoy learning everything related to computer science and I learn to use different programming tool and languages in my spare time.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying at [IUT Nice CÃ´te d'Azur](https://iut.univ-cotedazur.fr/) in computer science. I hope in the future to join an engineer school and also become a computer engineer. 
I use to upload my school projects on GitHub to help student and share my passion.
